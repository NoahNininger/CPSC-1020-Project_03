Challenge 1:    To create a customizable amount of rounds within the game, I simply just used a cin to enter a value in line 21.
                I also had the cin placed before the Player objects were created and before the shuffle() function so the player
                doesn't pick more cards than those already in the deck.

Challenge 2:    To create a scenario where the user can play as many games as desired, a simple do-while loop was placed around
                the majority of the program. To print out the summary of all the games, I created many variables to add up as the 
                loop went on and created a lengthy cout at the end of the program.
